# Vehicle Service System

## Assignment

In this project, you are required to develop a Vehicle Service System, which handles vehicle rentals and sales. The system includes various features like class inheritance, polymorphism, and File I/O operations.

### Assignment PDF
- You can find the detailed assignment in the uploaded PDF file: [Assignment.pdf](Assignment.pdf).

## Objectives
- Practice class inheritance and polymorphism.
- Learn how to use and implement abstract classes and interfaces.
- Learn to use File I/O (Reading/Writing from/to files).

## Files Provided with Assignment
- **Input file samples**:
  - `input.txt`: Contains all customers and vehicle details that need to be registered into the system. Also includes commands to generate vehicle services (sale or rental).
  
- **Output files**:
  - `output.txt`: Displays all registered records for customers, rental, and sale vehicles.

## System Description
This project is related to vehicle service agents by developing a computerized mechanism for selling and renting different kinds of vehicles. This will help in reducing manual and paperwork and therefore expected to enhance the overall service experience both for the customers and the agents. The vehicle service system provides different vehicle types for sale or rent.

The system you are required to develop is called Vehicle Store System. At the initial stage, the system will register all the available vehicle information either for renting or sale, and the customersâ€™ details from `input.txt`. Information read from `input.txt` is written with all the details into an output file, called `output.txt`.

After populating the data, the system will be ready for serving customers according to available vehicles. For a rent service, the customer ID and vehicle license details are read from `input.txt`. After processing the service, fare will be calculated and the details are written to the output file `output.txt`.

For a more detailed description of the system and commands, please follow the steps which will explain how to develop the system.

## Instructions
1. Install necessary libraries.
2. Implement classes and interfaces.
3. Write data handling functions for reading/writing to files.
4. Test and debug the system.
